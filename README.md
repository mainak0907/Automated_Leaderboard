The process.env object in Node.js is a representation of the user environment in which the Node.js process is running. It is an object that contains key-value pairs, where the keys are the names of environment variables and the values are the values of those environment variables.
Environment variables are values that are used by the operating system and by applications that are running on the operating system. They are typically used to store configuration settings, such as database connection strings, API keys, and other sensitive data.

Dotenv is a JavaScript package that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.
In other words, it allows you to store sensitive configuration information, such as API keys and database passwords, in a separate file that is not included in your code. This makes it more difficult for someone to hack your application and steal your data.

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. It is an easy-to-use library that can be used to make asynchronous requests to web servers. Axios is a popular choice for Node.js developers because it is fast, reliable, and easy to use.
